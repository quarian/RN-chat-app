# RN-chat-app

This is a simple chat app, written in React Native for the purpose of learning. It works with the backend, found
[here](https://github.com/quarian/RN-chat-app-backend).

The app shows basic scene functionality, networking thorugh http POST, GET and websockets and accessing images on the phone
(the last feature only implemented for Android).

Currently under constructin is a testing framework - both [Facebook Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and
[AirBnB Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) + [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) implementations are under testing.
Smoke tests for the web connections can be run with jest.
